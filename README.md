# visualizing-audio-data

This is a small python project that helps visualise the audio in (.wav) format as a wavelength graph and a spectogram.

## Audio Visualization

The program visualiser output:
 <img src="./img/1.png" width="350" title="hover text">
1. The upper subplot is a visualization of the waveform of the audio
2. The lower subplot is a spectograph of the diagram


## Compilation Instructions
